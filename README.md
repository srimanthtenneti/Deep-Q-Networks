# Deep-Q-Networks
This is a linux implementation of a unity environment where the agent has to learn to collect bananas. The implemented code is a deep Q neural network.

# Local Installation
1) Clone or download this repo : https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/
2) Then download the environment and unzip it into this folder : https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning/tree/master/p1_navigation
3) Make sure all of the files including the agent , navigation and model are in the same folder.
4) Then you are good to go.

# Required Libraries
1) Matplotlib - pip install matplotlib.
